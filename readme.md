The goal of node-telemtry is to make it really easy to deploy a scalable telemetry
server for small projects. This can be used to capture errors, performance data,
and more, and store it in a document store. Arbitrary inputs are supported by some 
backends, and of course any parameters may be attached to each document.

To install telemetry, run

    npm install -g telemetry

then edit your config.yaml, and run telemetry:

    telemetry
